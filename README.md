# Cookie-Clicker-Classic-Bot
A simple bot to automate playing Cookie Clicker Classic. 

The bot works by continuously clicking the cookie, checking the cookie "store" every five seconds, and 
purchasing the most expensive power-up available. The bot will only run for five minutes. 
After five minutes, the bot will stop and print the cookies per second. Due to the short run time, the 
bot does not implement any handling of the "Elder Pledge".

To run this bot, make sure to install the desired Chrome webdriver and provide your path
to it where it is noted in the code.

This code is my solution for the assignment on Day 48 of the Udemy course 
[100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
